  summary: |
    Insatiably curious with a special interest in new technologies and solving practical, real-world problems. 

    As a telecommunications engineer, I’ve developed both electronics and software solutions, focusing primarily on industrial monitoring, wireless networks and data gathering procedures.

    I also have ample experience on stem education projects applied to videogames and robotics, promoting the development of analytical and problem-solving skills.

    In the last few years, I’ve focused on software development—from desktop applications to api and web services, to spec design and system deployments.

    I pride myself on being a self-taught learner and highly adaptable, striving to bring innovative insight and a growth mindset to every endeavor.
